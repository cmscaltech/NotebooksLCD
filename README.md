# Deep Neural Networks for Imaging Calorimetry
Repository for my SURF Caltech-CMS project on deep learning for imaging calorimetry in the LCD (Linear Collider Detector), in which we reconstruct the energy of the particles by using regression.

This repository has the main notebooks, which use the macros from the [RegressionLCD](https://github.com/vitoriapacela/RegressionLCD) repository. This work is under development, please follow the "Regression_GammaEscan.ipynb" notebook for a walkthrough.

Pre-processing dependencies:
Danny Weitecamp's [CMS_Deep_Learning package](https://github.com/DannyWeitekamp/CMS_Deep_Learning) for the data generator.

Machine Learning dependencies:
[Keras](https://keras.io/) with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) in the backend.

Post-processing dependencies:
[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/).
